Transaction Analysis Dashboard
This repository hosts a data analysis and visualization dashboard built with Streamlit. The dashboard provides insights into transaction data, showcasing summary statistics and key visualizations to help identify patterns and trends across countries.

Overview
The Transaction Analysis Dashboard is designed to:

Present a user-friendly interface for exploring transaction data.
Offer valuable insights through summary statistics and visualizations.
Highlight top contributors in terms of transaction amounts.
The application is built in Python, using popular data science libraries like pandas for data handling, seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations, and streamlit for creating an interactive web interface.

Features
1. Display Raw Data
A toggle option in the sidebar allows users to view the raw data for reference, displayed in a table format.
2. Summary Statistics
Basic descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc., are calculated and displayed to give a quick overview of the dataset's structure.
3. Top 5 Countries by Transaction Amount
A bar chart visualizes the countries with the highest transaction totals, making it easy to identify significant contributors.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the following libraries:

streamlit: For building the web app interface.
pandas: For data loading and manipulation.
seaborn and matplotlib: For generating data visualizations.
plotly: For interactive charts.
Install these dependencies via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit pandas seaborn matplotlib plotly
Installation
Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine to get started:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transaction-analysis-dashboard.git
cd transaction-analysis-dashboard
Add the Dataset
Place your dataset (e.g., Big_Black_Money_Dataset.csv) in the project directory. Update the file path in app.py as needed:

python
Copy code
data = pd.read_csv("path_to_your_dataset.csv")
Running the Application
Once set up, you can run the application locally. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and execute:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to interact with the dashboard.

Project Structure
The project contains the following key files:

app.py: Main application file that initializes and configures the Streamlit dashboard, loads the data, and defines all data visualizations.
README.md: Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage details.
data/ (optional): Folder to store your dataset if you want to organize the data separately from the script.
Detailed Functionality
Sidebar Options
The sidebar allows users to:

Toggle the display of raw data, enabling them to view the complete dataset.
Adjust any future filter options (e.g., date range, country selection) as the application evolves.
Main Dashboard Sections
Dataset Overview

Shows the raw dataset if the "Show Raw Data" checkbox is selected. This section is useful for initial exploration and verification of the data's structure.
Summary Statistics

Provides key metrics such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for each numeric column. This quick summary helps users understand the overall distribution and range of values in the dataset.
Top 5 Countries by Transaction Amount

Ranks countries based on their total transaction amounts and displays the top 5 as a bar chart. This visualization helps identify regions with the highest transaction volumes.
Code Overview (app.py)
The app.py file includes:

Data Loading

The function load_data() loads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. The dataset is cached to optimize performance when the app is refreshed.
Statistical Summaries and Visualizations

st.write(df.describe()) displays summary statistics.
A Seaborn bar plot shows the top 5 countries by transaction amount, with a custom color palette for aesthetic appeal.
Example Dataset
This application expects a CSV file with at least the following columns:

Country: The country associated with each transaction.
Amount (USD): The transaction amount in USD.
Example Row:

Country	Amount (USD)
USA	1500
India	2300
If your dataset structure is different, update the column names accordingly in the app.py file.

Customization
You can customize the application by:

Adding new filters in the sidebar (e.g., filtering by transaction date, country, or transaction type).
Modifying visualizations to include other metrics or dimensions.
Integrating additional data analysis features as per project needs.
